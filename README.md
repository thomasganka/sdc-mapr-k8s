# sdc-mapr-k8s

This project builds a custom Docker image of StreamSets Data Collector (SDC)
with MapR v6.1 client and Kubernetes deployment support.

###   Configure and Build the Image

Switch to the <code>sdc-mapr-docker</code> directory.

Edit <code>build.sh</code> and make these changes:

* Set the image name

* Edit the list of stage libraries set in the <code>SDC_STAGE_LIBS</code> env var.  Make sure to include the <code>streamsets-datacollector-mapr_6_1-lib</code>  and <code>streamsets-datacollector-mapr_6_1-mep6-lib</code> stage libs. I've included the <code> streamsets-datacollector-jython_2_7-lib</code> library as an example.

* Edit the list of Enterprise stage libraries set in the <code>SDC_ENTERPRISE_STAGE_LIBS</code> env var.  I've included the <code>streamsets-datacollector-snowflake-lib-1.5.0</code> as an example.

Execute the <code>build.sh</code> script to build the image and push it to DockerHub.


###   Create Kubernetes Secrets for a MapR Service Ticket and Truststore

Generate or obtain a "long lived" MapR service ticket and place it in the <code>sdc-mapr-k8s/resources</code> directory (not in the similarly named <code>Resources</code> directory in the <code>sdc-mapr-docker</code> directory).  The file should have the name <code>longlived_ticket</code>.

Execute the script <code>create-mapr-ticket-secret.sh</code> to create a Secret for the ticket.

You must provide an <code>ssl_truststore</code> file for the MapR client. If you are connecting to a cluster deployed with self-signed certs, place a MapR <code>ssl_truststore</code> file in the <code>sdc-mapr-k8s/resources</code> directory. If not, you can use a copy of a JDK <code>cacerts</code> file renamed to <code>ssl_truststore</code>.  

Execute the script <code>create-mapr-truststore-secret.sh</code> to create a Secret for the Truststore.

### Set Deployment Properties

Edit the file <code>sdc-mapr-dep.yaml</code> and set the <code>MAPR_CLIENT_CONFIG</code> environment variable with the value needed to configure the MapR client for the target cluster.  The value is passed to the <code>/opt/mapr/server/configure.sh</code> command when the Container starts up.  For example, in my environment I use the string <code>"-N mark.mapr -c -secure -C 10.10.60.182:7222"</code>.

Also set a value for the <code>SDC_CONF_SDC_BASE_HTTP_URL</code> environment variable for Control Hub based deployment


### Launch the Deployment

Launch the Deployment with Control Hub and Control Agent, using the <code>sdc-mapr-dep.yaml</code>. A <code>sdc-mapr-svc.yaml</code> is included for a NodePort Service if needed. Ingress could also be configured if desired.


### Run a Pipeline

If all goes well you should be able to reach the newly deployed SDC's UI.  No additional steps are needed to authenticate to MapR as the MapR client is initialized and the service ticket is in the expected location.

Create a pipeline that reads from MapRfs as a test, like this:

<img src="images/pipeline.png" alt="pipeline" width="800"/>


Preview the pipeline to inspect the data being read:

<img src="images/preview.png" alt="preview" width="800"/>


Run the pipeline:

<img src="images/read-from-mapr.png" alt="read-from-mapr" width="800"/>

Write to MapRfs:

<img src="images/write-to-mapr.png" alt="write-to-mapr" width="800"/>

###   Implementation Notes

* StreamSets' [setup-mapr](https://streamsets.com/documentation/datacollector/latest/help/datacollector/UserGuide/Installation/MapR-Prerequisites.html#concept_umx_15q_xz) command is called at build time by the Docker Container's [sdc-configure.sh ](https://github.com/onefoursix/sdc-mapr-k8s/blob/78a828762491151ced4b1fb041109d8412c4bd5c/sdc-mapr-docker/sdc-configure.sh#L101) script.

* MapR's [configure.sh](https://docs.datafabric.hpe.com/61/ReferenceGuide/configure.sh.html) script is called at runtime from the [docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/onefoursix/sdc-mapr-k8s/blob/78a828762491151ced4b1fb041109d8412c4bd5c/sdc-mapr-docker/docker-entrypoint.sh#L19) script using the MapR cluster's name and URL set in the [deployment manifest](https://github.com/onefoursix/sdc-mapr-k8s/blob/78a828762491151ced4b1fb041109d8412c4bd5c/sdc-mapr-dep.yaml#L26). 

### HPE Deployment Notes

* You need know Gateway IP of the Cluster Worker Node to configure the code>SDC_CONF_SDC_BASE_HTTP_URL</code>. I obtained it by using the HPE Admin Console under the kubeadmin.

* Service annotation for HPE is slighly different. Please see HPE/sdc-svc.yaml for an example.

* Secure MapR Cluster (HPE) - Long Lived Ticket must be in the same namespace as the streamsets deployment. In this case, I just copied over the ticket uses a command like this: <code> kubectl get secret hpe-ticket-secret --namespace=hpe-csi --export -o yaml | kubectl apply --namespace=streamsets -f - </code>
  
* Secure MapR Client - Requires an SSL Truststore. If MapR Cluster uses Self Signed Certs, they need to be added to ssl-truststore. If the MapR Cluster uses  certs signed by a well known CA, then the java cacerts file can be used.
